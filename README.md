### Jablko

This is me trying to roll my own extendable smart home software and not rely on external providers/devices. The whole IOT and smart home product industry is full of exceptionally poor security decisions and vendors selling suspicious products that operate more like black boxes. A great example of this Amazon Sidewalk. Consumers were not made aware that the products they were buying were planned the be a part of a mesh-net that would transmit their data without any user control. This feature was "added" recently but was most likely part of Amazon's development plan. Not having control or knowing what exactly an IOT device is doing is a huge security oversight. 

Other poor examples of IOT devices are internet connected cameras that have security fails such as allowing arbitrary shell commands to be executed as root without authentication (vstarcam is one I am aware of). Another strange aspect of IOT devices is that some run systems with far more complexity/capacity than needed. A lot of "ip" connected devices ship with stripped down versions of Linux. For most IOT applications I can think of, there is NO need to have this level of complexity. 

My goal with Jablko is to experiment with different architectures and learning about network communications and authenticaation.
